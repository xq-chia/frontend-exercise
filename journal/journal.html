            Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Walla Walla, WA</li> 
            <li>Magic City, ID,</li>
            <li>Bountiful, UT,</li>
            <li>Last Chance, CO,</li>
            <li>Why, AZ</li>
            <li>Truth or Consequence, NM</li>
        </ol>

            I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: 
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Passing cars,<br>
            When you can't see,<br>
            May get you, <br>
            A glimpse. <br>
            Of eternity.<br>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            I definitely won't be passing any cars. 
        </p>

        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>cell phone</li> 
            <li>iPod</li>
            <li>digital camera</li>
            <li>and a protein bar</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of thousand miles begins with one Segway.<q>
